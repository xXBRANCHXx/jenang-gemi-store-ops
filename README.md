# Jenang Gemi Store Ops

Operational backend for `store.jenanggemi.com`.

## Scope

- SKU database and master catalog
- Inventory and stock thresholds
- Orders and order-edit workflow
- COGS history and operational pricing inputs
- Webhook and API integrations to external systems

## Current routes

- `/dashboard/`
- `/sku-db/`
- `/sku-db/new/`
- `/inventory/`
- `/orders/`
- `/integrations/`
- `/logout/`
- `/api/orders/`

## Notes

- Store ops now treats `/sku-db/` as a read-only mirror of the live shared SKU MySQL database.
- New SKU creation and approvals have moved to the executive dashboard.
- `/sku-db/new/` now redirects back to `/sku-db/`.
- The fulfillment dashboard reads live Shopee `READY_TO_SHIP` orders through `/api/orders/`, which proxies the ingest service without exposing Shopee tokens to browser JavaScript.
- `/api/orders/` also merges partner orders from the Partner Portal feed when `store_ops_orders_token` / `JG_STORE_OPS_ORDERS_TOKEN` is configured. Override the feed URL with `partner_orders_feed_url` / `JG_PARTNER_ORDERS_FEED_URL` if needed. Direct partner database access remains an optional fallback through `partner_db_*` / `JG_PARTNER_DB_*`.
- Partner shipping labels are proxied from the Partner Portal feed or `partner_portal_base_url` / `JG_PARTNER_PORTAL_BASE_URL` when uploaded by the partner portal.
